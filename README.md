# Riddles in the Dark

## https://ethyl2.github.io/riddles/

My company recently had a retreat, and one of the highlights was playing a game where we wandered around a house in the dark, looking for riddles hidden in the various rooms. I thought it would be fun to try recreating a bit of that experience with a web app.

I would love your contributions.
Please clone this repo and either add more riddles (easy peasy), or even more features (if you have a little more time).
Then submit a pull request.

## Future Feature Possibilities

1. A timer, to see how fast a user can find the riddle and solve it.
2. Additional choices of images for the rooms and the masks.
3. A button to load another room and/or riddle.
4. A score display -- how many riddles did the user solve, out of the ones attempted.
5. A way to display the answer if the user gives up.
6. What else sounds interesting?
